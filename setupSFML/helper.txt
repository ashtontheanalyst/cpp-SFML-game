Running this command to compile each time is a lot:

g++ test.cpp -o prog -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system


So instead, in the .bashrc file I wrote this function:

bsfml() {
    if [ $# -lt 2 ]; then
        echo "Usage: bsf <fileName.cpp> <outputName>"
        return 1
    fi
    g++ "$1" -o "$2" -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
}

Therefore now you can just compile with all those library packages like this:

bsfml test.cpp prog
